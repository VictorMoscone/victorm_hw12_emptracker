# 12 Victor Moscone's Employee Tracker - HW12

## Tracking You Until The End Of Time

**A quick description**: Management can be tough, much less running an entire business. It sure gets a lot easier when you're able to quickly view, add, and update a back-end spreadsheet of all of your busy-bees. This node app allows you to do just that, with a nice and simple step-by-step process.

So clone this repo and run `node app.js` to get started!

## Reflection

Holy cow, was this assignment frustrating. A majority of the assignment was a breeze. I was able to leverage class activities to get a good understanding of how to format the MySQL queries - but man, I spent 8 hours trying to make a general query function work and it just drove me insane. Eventually I was forced to use nested callbacks so my queries would behave.

## Setup Instructions

---

1. Clone this repo!
2. Right click on the repo folder and open Git Bash.
3. Type `npm install` to get the required modules.
4. Use the schema.sql and seeds.sql files to populate your MySQL workbench.
5. Ensure your connection paramters (namely password) match the ones found in app.js.
6. In Git Bash, type `node app.js` to run the app!
